# CEO-Request Challenge: Improving Olist's Profit📈💲

Problem Statement 💡
How can Olist increase its profitability?

Key Findings 📊

1- Wait time is the primary factor influencing low review scores.

2- Seller selection can significantly impact wait time and reduce bad reviews.

3- Seller and product-related issues contribute to negative reviews.

4- Olist's IT costs scale with the number of sellers and items sold.

***Hypotheses Overview 💡***

**First Hypothesis** (Remove Under-Performing Sellers from Marketplace) 🚫🛒 Olist can increase profits by removing underperforming sellers who generate low profits and high costs, particularly IT costs.

**Second Hypothesis** (Remove Worst-Performing Categories) 🛑 Olist should remove the worst-performing product categories with low review scores and long wait times to reduce negative customer feedback and improve overall satisfaction.

**Third Hypothesis** (Tiered Seller Program) 🏅 Implementing a tiered seller program based on performance (e.g., review scores, delivery times) can optimize subscription fees and incentivize seller improvements, thereby increasing profitability.
